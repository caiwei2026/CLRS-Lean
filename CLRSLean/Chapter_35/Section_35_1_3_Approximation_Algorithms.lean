# Chapter 35.1-35.3 — Approximation Algorithms

Formalizes three classic deterministic approximation algorithms from CLRS:
APPROX-VERTEX-COVER (a 2-approximation, Theorem 35.1),
APPROX-TSP-TOUR (a 2-approximation with triangle inequality, Theorem 35.2), and
GREEDY-SET-COVER (an H(n) approximation, Theorem 35.4).

Status: definitions and theorem statements complete; approximation-ratio
proofs are deferred (sorry).

Dependencies: uses DecisionProblem and the decision-variant types from
Chapter 34 to connect optimization problems to their NP-hard decision
counterparts.

the selected vertex set; for TSP, the total length of the tour; for set cover,
the number of selected sets. -/

/-! # 35.1 — APPROX-VERTEX-COVER: a 2-approximation

We model an undirected graph as a GraphInstance (from Chapter 34.4),
working with the optimization version: find a vertex cover of minimum
size.  The algorithm iterates over the edge list, and whenever it finds
an edge with neither endpoint already in the cover, it adds both endpoints.
